RetroIDL
========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cjhdev/retro_idl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cjhdev/retro_idl)

RetroIDL is an experiment to explore the usefulness of combing a subset
of ASN.1, OER, and a set of conventions to produce a standards based 
serialisation tool with similar utility to 
Google Protocol Buffers, Apache Thrift, Apache Avro, and the many others.
